# Support creating Dependabot PRs for GitHub releases

# Dependabot supports updating GitHub Actions (this file) whenever a project creates
# a new tag/release. By listing the projects/tools in the action, we get a PR
# from Dependabot for any release of these projects. The version is then parsed
# from this file, in the `*/install` targets in the tardigrade-ci `Makefile`.

# Pinning tool versions this way should be a last resort, since GitHub prevents
# services like Mergify from automatically merging pull requests that modify
# `.github/workflows`. Only add a tool here if there is no other option for pinning
# the version.
